# QA Report - Ecommerce Application

## Test Summary
This QA cycle focused on validating the core ecommerce flows and demos: product browsing, product details, variant handling, add to cart, cart management (quantity/remove/persistence), basic checkout validation, responsive behavior, and error handling (e.g., offline states). Additional verification covered the AI Catalog (smart search, pricing, recommendations) and the Blockchain demo (wallet connect/network change/transaction states). Testing was conducted manually on Chrome, with spot checks on Safari and Firefox.

## Test Coverage
- Product browsing and grid rendering
- Product details and variant selection persistence
- Add to Cart: in-stock, out-of-stock, multiple variants
- Cart updates: quantity increase/decrease, remove item, persistence via localStorage
- Checkout page presence and basic validation
- Responsive behavior (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Error states (offline product load, offline add-to-cart)
- AI Catalog modes: Smart, Pricing, Recommendations
- Blockchain demo: connect/disconnect, network switch, transaction lifecycle

## Cross-Browser/Device
- Chrome (desktop): Passed core scenarios
- Safari/Firefox (desktop): Spot checks OK for listing/cart; verify toasts and focus outlines
- Mobile (iOS/Android via devtools): Layout responsive; navbar collapses; action buttons usable

## Suggestions
- Persist AI Catalog mode in URL or localStorage for better UX
- Show variant in cart line items and ensure variant forms part of cart key
- Add stock validation on cart page quantity controls
- Standardize error toasts for offline/network failures
- Improve keyboard focus outlines for accessibility; ensure Enter/Space triggers Add to Cart
